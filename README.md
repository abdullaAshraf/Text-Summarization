# Reflection
This is a project made for a customer as a software tool to demonstrate concepts for a PhD degree.
# Implementation
The idea of the app is to allow users to enter a large text (from a textbook or an article), select the number of sentences they want to a ratio from the main text, choose any important words and/or features they want to include, then the app select top sentences using `Particle swarm optimization` , `Gong and Liu` , features-based algorithm and a final algorthim the combine the results of the previous 3 with scores and select the top sentences amoung all of them.
in the results page the user can switch between the results of all the algorthims , sort them by score or by occurrence, highlight the output in the original text and print the results.
